        <h1>ðŸ’š Happy Girlfriendâ€™s Day ðŸ’š</h1>
        <p class="apology">
            Aashi, I know Iâ€™ve made mistakes â€” big ones, small ones, maybe even ones I didnâ€™t realize at the time. 
            But today, I just want to pause everything and say one thing from the bottom of my heart: Iâ€™m sorry.
            <br><br>
            Iâ€™m sorry for the times I overthought and let my fears get louder than your love.
            Iâ€™m sorry for the times my words hurt you, when all I ever wanted was to protect you.
            Iâ€™m sorry if I ever made you feel like you werenâ€™t enough â€” because youâ€™re more than enough, youâ€™re everything to me.
            Iâ€™m sorry for the moments I let my own demons get in the way of your peace.
            I'm sorry for the moments I crossed boundaries.
            <br><br>
            But please know, not a single mistake came from a lack of love.
            If anything, itâ€™s because I love you too much â€” so much that I panic at the thought of losing you, or messing this up.
            Youâ€™re the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me.
            You saved me, in more ways than youâ€™ll ever know.
            You gave me a home when I didnâ€™t even believe in the word.
            <br><br>
            And I promise â€” Iâ€™m trying every day to be better for you, to be the man you deserve.
            Iâ€™ll heal with you, grow with you, laugh with you, cry with you â€” everything, but only if I get to do it with you.
            <br><br>
            So this is me, asking for your forgiveness, your understanding, and your hand â€” still. Always.
            <br><br>
            Iâ€™m sorry. I love you. Iâ€™m yours â€” completely.
