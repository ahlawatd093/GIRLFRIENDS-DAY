        <h1>💚 Happy Girlfriend’s Day 💚</h1>
        <p class="apology">
            Aashi, I know I’ve made mistakes — big ones, small ones, maybe even ones I didn’t realize at the time. 
            But today, I just want to pause everything and say one thing from the bottom of my heart: I’m sorry.
            <br><br>
            I’m sorry for the times I overthought and let my fears get louder than your love.
            I’m sorry for the times my words hurt you, when all I ever wanted was to protect you.
            I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like you weren’t enough — because you’re more than enough, you’re everything to me.
            I’m sorry for the moments I let my own demons get in the way of your peace.
            I'm sorry for the moments I crossed boundaries.
            <br><br>
            But please know, not a single mistake came from a lack of love.
            If anything, it’s because I love you too much — so much that I panic at the thought of losing you, or messing this up.
            You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.
            You saved me, in more ways than you’ll ever know.
            You gave me a home when I didn’t even believe in the word.
            <br><br>
            And I promise — I’m trying every day to be better for you, to be the man you deserve.
            I’ll heal with you, grow with you, laugh with you, cry with you — everything, but only if I get to do it with you.
            <br><br>
            So this is me, asking for your forgiveness, your understanding, and your hand — still. Always.
            <br><br>
            I’m sorry. I love you. I’m yours — completely.
        </p>

        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>Well okay, let's start this! The preparations were yours — for Girlfriend's Day 💖. I told you I would make it special, and sorry, but I could not think of anything much better than this 😅. So here is the plan — starting now, you are going to get a paragraph every one hour until the end of the day ⏰. A few pictures and videos too 📸🎥. And at the end of the day, there is a little surprise for you! 🎁 

I do not know if you will like it or not, but yeah... it is a little surprise that you will have to wait 24 hours for 😈. I will name this little thing "24 Shades of Boyfriend" — I do not know, could not be more creative hehe 😜. 

I have not started anything yet — this is just the very beginning 🥹. So that is pretty much it for now. Oh, and do not worry about saving the texts and pics — I will send a Word file the next day. Do not worry about that, okay? 😌 

Oh, and I have a new idea too — seriously, I used a lot of brainpower for all this 😤💡! I think I should leave this paragraph as the introduction to your day, so you will be in suspense for what is coming next... hehehe I am evil, I know 😈😈. But okay... 

And you are absolutely sleeping, darling 💤. No waking up for this or anything 😘. 

Cannot wait for you to see the last surprise! 🥺💘 And your reaction. Btw I tried to keep punctuations in it and few emojis. I hope you will like it colorful. HEHEHEHEH!!!!!!!!!! 

And i tried to write all this in a gentle man’s way 
 
 Okay, let’s begin with the very first paragraph. It is 1 AM, and an hour has passed since Girlfriend’s Day has started 💗. And I just want to say... 
 I love you, my stupid, idiotic girlfriend and my future life partner 💍🥺. 

I am so glad that I gathered all the courage and proposed to you that day — I mean on 12th of June, at 12:28 PM. That was the best decision of my life. Honestly, the only one that did not go south — and has absolutely no chance of going wrong as long as I am alive ❤️. 

I know I am not a perfect boyfriend or partner. I do childish things, galtiyaan karta hoon, mood swings bhi hote hain, but I am not letting you go, no matter what my flaws are. There might be a billion men better than me out there — but my baby, I love you, and you are absolutely mine, okay? 😤💘 

And you know what? You were literally my dream. I still cannot believe till now that I could have even been friends with you — partner toh dur ki baat thi 🥹. It still feels unreal sometimes — like, how did I get so lucky? ✨💭 

Now let’s talk about that day — 12th June. You know na, it took so much courage for me to type that proposal that I literally got a fever from overthinking 🤒😅. And yeah, I acted like I was drunk 🙈. I should not have — but okay, that is what made us us today. 

And you know what? That day literally changed me — from absolute darkness to absolute light ✨. Because of you, I became a living person again — happy, enjoying life, full of light and warmth. I genuinely cannot feel any darkness inside me anymore. 

You made me the human I always wished to be. Because of you, I now know what emotions are, how to feel them, how to express them. Because of you, I know what happiness is, how not to choose violence or rage. It is a blessing that you never saw that side of me — and I promise, you never will. 🤞💖 

And baby, above all, I am so, so grateful for you. 
 Grateful for your love. 
 Grateful for your patience. 
 Grateful that you chose me. 
 You could have walked away a hundred times, but you stayed — and I can never thank you enough for that 💗. 

I am grateful for every "good morning" and every "sweet dreams" you gave me 🌅🌙. 
 Grateful for your silly little jokes that instantly lift my mood. 
 Grateful for how you handle me when I act stubborn or immature. 
 Grateful for your voice — it’s the calmest sound I have ever heard 🎧. 
 Grateful for the way your eyes light up when you're happy — it's my favorite sight 👀✨. 
 Grateful that you forgive me, even when I don’t deserve it. 
 Grateful for how you support me quietly, without needing credit. 
 Grateful that you taught me what love really feels like — safe, peaceful, and strong 💞. 
 Grateful for how you make the smallest moments feel like the biggest blessings. 
 Grateful for simply existing — because your existence alone gave my life meaning 💫. 

So let’s end this little moment here, with lots and lots of hugs and kisses for you 🫂😘💋. 
 Thank you for being mine. Thank you for staying. 

Happy 1 AM, meri jaan. This is only the beginning 💌. 

 

 

 Okay, moving ahead to our second paragraph at 2 AM 💫... 

Let’s go to the part where I saw you for the first time after our little confession. You looked like an angel from heaven, sweetheart 😭👼. You already know this, but I will say it again — my legs were literally shaking. I was drinking water like, “Fuck, how do I face her? I’m looking like an animal!”* 🫠 

And you... you weren’t even able to reply. It was so funny, so cute, so adorable 🥺. I never knew you were so shy. But now I know — and trust me, it is one of the most lovable things about you. You being shy is like... next-level adorable. Mujhe toh uss time laga ki you had a million second thoughts after seeing me in person. Like, “Bhai kya janwar hai ye… okay I’m blocking him the moment I reach home. Shit, I liked him? Eww.” 😂😭 

And I kept overthinking so much that I literally stood in the balcony for 7 hours, just thinking… “I messed it up. I should’ve just stayed friends. She deserves better. Why did I even propose?” And more, and more... my mind was spinning endlessly that night 💔. 

But then came our official first meet, with no one else around — just you, me, and that slightly crashed car 🚗💥. I messed up that day too — being late, running through Delhi like a madman. Literally breaking every law, ignoring people, traffic, chaos — all I could think was: 

“Please stay. Please don’t go. Please God, please... this can’t be the end. Not like this.” 

I was terrified. When I finally reached you, I was still shaking. I had never been that afraid of losing someone before 🫠💔. And because of that fear, I could not even drive properly — that was such a funny mess 😅. 

But then I saw you — cute, beautiful, and perfect 😍. My love just started increasing right there. That day, that moment... it all hit differently. You said I acted like a kid while showing you my hostel — yeah, maybe I did. But you smiled, sweetheart, and that made everything worth it 😇. 

Then we went to McDonald’s — classic us 🍔🥤. We always end up eating something on our dates. Are we secretly foodies? Maybe. Probably. 100% confirmed. But honestly, I would love to take you out like that every time, no matter the distance, no matter the time, no matter the place. I want to be your personal Uber driver forever 🚗💘. 

So no need to learn driving, okay? You already have me. Always be my passenger princess, sweetheart. Forever by my side 💗👑. 

 

You know, I never thought life could be this beautiful. 
 I never thought someone like you — so soft, so precious — would ever walk into my life. 
 You came like a surprise, and stayed like a blessing. 
 And even after all this time, you still make my heart beat faster. 
 You make even the most normal days feel magical. 
 Your smile is home to me. 
 Your voice is peace to me. 
 And your presence is everything I need. 
 Every little moment with you is carved in gold inside my memory. 
 And I just hope... we keep making these memories, one after another, forever 💫💞. 

So here’s your 2 AM dose of love, sweetheart. 
 Only 22 more to go 😉 
 I love you, with everything I am 🫶 

 3 AM... 
 I am sleepy as fuck, but I’ve got to do what I have to do, right sweetheart? 😴💗 
 Anyway, let’s move on to another beautiful memory — 
 Our metro date. The day I dropped you to the metro station. 

I cannot lie — I felt so good being your personal chauffeur that day 🚗💼. Carrying your bag, walking beside you... just existing near you like your guy — your person — it felt perfect. I still feel bad for denying you that ice cream, though 🙈. I should’ve said yes. Always yes to you. 

We were walking towards the metro station and you gave me your bag and a few things to hold. And sweetheart, I can’t explain it — but I felt so warm inside. Like, yayyyy... she actually trusts me, she accepts me as hers 🥺. Even if it was just a bag, to me it was like being chosen for something special. 

Then there was that part — the railway line — you were wearing heels 👠, and I swear, I wanted to pick you up every time we crossed that path. Like, carry you all the way. But I held back — thinking, “No, it’s too soon... she might feel uncomfortable...” But that thought stayed in my heart. The want to take care of you like that has never left. 

And then came that moment... 
 I held your hand. For the very first time 💞. 
 Helping you jump over that small wall or step or whatever it was — that tiny gesture hit different. After you left, I remember thinking, “Come on bro, bas haath pakda tha...” But still, everything just felt a thousand times more intense with you. Every little thing with you has weight, feeling, magic. 

We reached the metro. I think we went to Xero Degrees, right? And it was so much fun. 
 You, being your smart cute self, got me an extra mojito — hehe my clever sweetheart 😚🥤. That day was small in time but huge in emotion. 

And then came the metro ride — we talked, laughed, shared random little things. And at Saket, we got out and sat there together. Your head resting on my shoulder... and istg, that moment? That moment felt like the entire world just disappeared 🌍🫶. 

It was peaceful. Too peaceful. 
 And to this day, I don’t know why these little things with you hit me so deep. 
 Your head on my shoulder, your hand brushing mine, your voice in my ear — it all feels like something out of a dream. 

I remember thinking, “Please God, can this time just freeze? I don't want this to end.” 

But it did. We had to get up. And you had to watch me go. 
 And sweetheart, I cannot lie — it felt heart-crushing to leave you there. 
 Every single time we part ways, there's this tiny ache in my chest that says, 
 "Stay. Just a little longer." 

 

You’re not just a person to me anymore. 
 You’re a feeling. 
 A safe place. 
 A warm hug in the coldest moment. 
 The peace my overthinking brain never knew it needed. 
 And all these simple, “small” memories — walking, talking, sitting, laughing — they’ve become my entire world 🌍💗. 

So here’s your 3 AM letter, sweetheart. 
 Tired, half-asleep me still hopelessly in love with every second we’ve spent together. 
 And every second still to come ⏳💌 

 4 AM, baby! 
 Sleep? What is that? I don’t know her 😭💀 
 But love letters? Hell yeah, we doing this all night! 
 So let’s go to one of my favorite memories — our Half Fried dates 🥢❤️ 

So, the first time we went to Half Fried — I didn’t even know that place existed before you told me. But then we just sat there together and had chilli potatoes — and OMG, those were the best chilli potatoes I’ve ever had in my life 🔥. 
 And you know what? I’m pretty damn sure I liked them just because you were there. Your presence legit increases the taste of everything 😭✨ 

Also, I love the fact that we never judged each other for how messy we eat 😭 
 That was the only reason I used to avoid food dates — but with you? It felt like home. No awkwardness, no filters — just us, being stupid and cute and eating like monsters. 
 Honestly, I wanted to hug you right then and there. Even now, I just wanna grab you and squeeze the life outta you 🫂💗 

Then the second Half Fried memory — it started raining 🌧️. 
 Normally, we both hate the rain, but that day? Sitting there, eating and watching the rain with you felt so peaceful. 
 Like, for the first time, I didn't hate it. I actually liked it. Because you were with me. 
 That’s the effect you have on me, sweetheart — you make the worst things feel beautiful. 

Also, that was our messiest food date 😂 
 And also the one we laughed the most on. 
 It was just so peaceful, so random, and so full of warmth when I think about it now 🥹💗 

That was also the day we first held hands. 
 Okay okay, technically you were holding my thumb  😤💕 
 But I’m counting it, because it felt electric. Like something just clicked inside me. 

And yeah, I’m still grateful to Joginder for calling and pissing me off that day 😂 
 Because in that tiny moment of anger, I grabbed your hand — and everything inside me calmed. Like instantly. 
 Holding your hand was like touching peace. 

AND THEN... you looked at my hand and turned it into a whole-ass tourist destination 💀 
 You said I had four mountains, a lake, a forest, a resort — pata nahi kya kya 🌄🏞️ 
 You stupid idiot... I swear I love you so much 😭💗 

Oh and THEN came your first palm massage by me 😌 
 And for some reason, you absolutely loved it — idk if you were faking it or not, but sweetheart, I’m ready to give you a full body massage at the end of every single day for the rest of your life 🫡💆‍♀️ 
 I legit felt so happy doing it. 
 Agar metro par na hote... I would’ve given you a foot massage too 😤😂 

Anyway — you make me feel so peaceful, sweetheart. 
 I don't even know how to explain it anymore. 
 You're chaos and calm, laughter and light — all in one. 

 

And there it is. Your 4 AM letter — written with sleepy eyes and a heart so full. 
 Still 20 more to go, sweetheart. 
 But with you, even writing at 4 AM feels like falling in love all over again 💞 

 5 AM, sweetheart. 
 Little bit of a headache kicking in, not gonna lie — but anything, literally anything, for my sweet little darling 😚💖 
 Also, just realized by 6, I’ll be done with all the date letters and move into the next surprise — gotta plan that too. But first... 

Let’s jump straight into our Aravalli date — honestly, probably our best date so far. 
 Why? Because we had privacy, we had peace, and we had each other — for hours 💞 

Okay, I know, I messed up again that day 😔 
 I was late, made you wait in the damn sun — I’m so sorry for that. But once we got going, with your legendary navigation skills (not taunting — genuinely, you’re good at this stuff 🤌), we made it to Aravalli. 

You know, I never thought I’d be up on a hill with you this early in our relationship. 
 But here we were. 
 Next time? Let’s try real mountains 😏🏔️ 
 Let’s go higher, longer, deeper — just like our bond keeps growing every day. 
 I may have irritated you on the way there (a bit too much maybe 😬), but thank you — for still holding my hand, smiling, and walking beside me. 

We picked a little downhill spot and sat there for what? 
 8 straight hours. 
 And honestly? It didn’t feel like 8 minutes. 
 Time disappeared around you. I swear, it’s like when I’m with you — the world presses pause. 
 No noise, no stress, no future, no past. Just you, and me 💗 

I gave you your first foot massage that day 😌 
 And idk why, but it felt so... real. Like something I want to do at the end of every day — for the rest of your life. 
 You don’t even have to ask — your comfort will always be my job. Main hoon na. 🫶 

We read the notes you’d brought, and yeah... I know, I grabbed your phone and read that one trash note — I shouldn’t have. I’m sorry. 
 And I’m especially sorry for reading Avi’s note — that was personal, and I had no right. 
 I know I crossed a line there. 
 But you know what? 
 I still somehow guessed the password — genius boyfriend things 😎 
 I forgot it now though.  

And then you tried to make me watch Never Have I Ever 😭💀 
 But I swear, sweetheart, I couldn’t even focus. 
 Because your beauty? Your cuteness? It was attacking my brain. 
 Like, how tf am I supposed to watch anything when you’re sitting right beside me looking like an angel that just got lost and fell into my arms? 

Which reminds me... 
 After a few moments, you were magically just there — in my arms. 
 And I held you close, and I swear to God, I just wanted time to stop forever. 
 Like... “Okay cool, world can end now. I’m good. This is heaven.” 

We clicked pics, made memories, laughed, teased — moments I’ll never forget. 
 Then came your eternal talking phase 😭 
 Sweetheart, I was SO sleepy. My brain was short-circuiting. 
 And I just kept thinking — “How is this girl not running out of breath?? Someone shut her up for 1 second. Let her breathe!” 
 But I swear — I loved every word. 
 Because even when I’m too tired to process it, your voice calms me. 
 And I kept listening, like “Don’t go anywhere. I’ll hear it all. Talk for hours. I’m not leaving.” 

But yeah... 
 Then came my worst mistake. 
 Sweetheart, I’m really sorry. I don’t even know how, but I just... leaned in. 
 I tried to kiss you without asking — and I immediately regretted it. 
 You didn’t deserve that. 
 You made me feel so safe, so loved — and I crossed a line I wasn’t supposed to. 

And the worst part? You thought my mood was off on the way home. 
 You didn’t even realize it was guilt. Pure guilt. 
 I couldn’t say it properly then, but I’m saying it now: I’m really sorry. 
 I respect you more than anything. 
 And no matter how hot or beautiful or irresistible you are (because you are, sweetheart 😮‍💨🔥), I promise to always think about your comfort first. 

And even with that regret, I still had a beautiful time with you. 
 We tickled, teased, laughed, — it was us. 
 Imperfect. Real. Beautiful. ❤️ 

 

You’re my peace. 
 My calm. 
 My fire. 
 My weakness. 
 And also my strength. 
 And sweetheart, no matter how stupid or idiotic we both act sometimes — I wouldn’t want this with anyone else but you 🫶 

That was our Aravalli memory — 
 A messy, magical, unforgettable date. 
 And I’d relive it a thousand times over, just to feel that warmth again 💌 

 

Now get ready, darling — 
 We’re done with all the date recaps. 
 From 6 AM onward… something new is coming. 
 Something deeper. Something called: 
 “24 Shades of Your Boyfriend.” 
 Let’s begin soon 💘 

  

6 AM, baby. 
 Our last official date letter. 
 I know I missed a few in between, but I wanted to write something different next — something new and special... so I had to wrap the dates here. 

And what better way to end than with one of the most underrated and beautiful memories of us — 
 Our bike ride date. 

The first time you ever sat on a bike with me. 
 And I swear on everything I have — that feeling? That feeling was even better than Aravalli. 
 I’m not kidding. 

That day felt like magic in motion. 
 Your arms around me, that soft drizzle, you sitting behind me like you belonged there forever — 
 It was perfect. Just you and me. The road. The wind. The sky. 
 No noise. No drama. Just peace 💗 

You know what made me melt though? 
 When you said, “I don’t let anyone use me as a handrest.” 
 Well guess what, sweetheart — 
 I don’t use anyone as a handrest either. 
 And somehow… you let me. 
 And I did it only with you. 
 The irony? Freaking adorable. 
 You’re mine. I’m yours. No one else even makes sense anymore 😚 

That day, I felt like your personal Rapido driver, and honestly? 
 Hire me full-time. 
 No salary needed. Just pay me in your smiles, head kisses, and hand squeezes 😭 
 Even though I was low that day, and you knew it — you were healing it. Slowly, softly. 
 Just by being there. 

When I dropped you off in that soft drizzle, and you looked back with that tiny smile... 
 Sweetheart, that moment stuck with me. 
 It wasn’t dramatic. 
 But it was ours. 
 And that made it beautiful. 

On my way back, your head on my shoulder? 
 That one gesture brought us a thousand steps closer. 

 
And honestly... I can’t wait for more. 
 More bike rides, more monsoons, more silence filled with love. 
 You behind me, arms tight, wind in our faces, hearts connected — 
 That's exactly how I want my everyday to be. 
 You, riding through life with me. 

Also… new update, sweetheart 📝 
 I’m changing the name from “24 Shades of Your Boyfriend” to 
 “24 Hours with Your Clingy Boyfriend” 💅 
 Because let’s be honest — I’m not dramatic or poetic... 
 I’m just your overattached, madly in love, hopelessly clingy idiot boyfriend. 
 And I wouldn’t want to be anyone else 😤💘 

 

So here ends the memory chapter. 
 Dates, hugs, food, kisses, chaos, all sealed in love. 
 What’s next? You’ll see. 
 But for now — your 6 AM letter is ready. 
 From your clingy biker boy who just wants more hours with his passenger princess 🫶🏍️👑 

 

 7 AM, sweetheart 🌄 
 Another hour, another little piece of my heart for you. 

I just wanna say — I’m looking forward to many more Girlfriend’s Days with you… 
 Many more relationship milestones, 
 Maybe even wifey days someday 👰💍 
 Anniversaries, birthdays, random Tuesdays, Holi, Diwali, Valentine’s, Sundays... 
 Literally every single day life has to offer — I wanna celebrate with you. 
 Because you’re not just someone I love — 
 You’re someone I want to spend my entire life loving 💗 

Sweetheart, I swear to God — 
 This is the first time in my entire life that I’ve truly fallen in love. 
 Like, properly. Deeply. Fully. 

This is exactly how I imagined love would be — but what I never imagined was how soft I’d become. 
 You’ve melted me in ways I didn’t think were possible 🫠 
 Even just holding your hand makes me feel things I never allowed myself to feel. 

Because melting me? 
 Impossible. Ask anyone who’s known me. 

People used to stay away from me — 
 I was that stone-hearted guy. 
 Everyone said it: 
 "Itna stone-hearted bhi acha nahi hota." 
 "Bhai thode toh emotions laa" 

No one had ever seen a single atom of water in my eyes. 
 Not even a crack. 
 I hadn’t cried since I was 8. Not once. 
 Not from pain, not from loss, not from love. 
 I had just two moods: 
 Laughing while irritating people, or complete straight face — emotionless. 

Till 10th, I was so deep into the wrong crowd, the wrong energy, 
 I forgot the difference between fear and respect. 
 I had built walls so high, even I forgot how to climb them. 

But sweetheart... 
 You broke every one of those walls. 
 With just love. With patience. With care. 
 Without even knowing it, you became the safe space I always needed but never found. 
 I made sure none of my past ever reached Bahadurgarh, because that was the only place where I felt like I could be normal. Where I still hoped to make real friends. 

And now, here I am... 
 Living a life I thought I’d never get. 
 Living my dream. 
 The kind of love I craved for all my life — and it’s with you 🥺🫶 

The way I imagined my perfect person — the girl I waited for, the one I thought didn’t even exist — 
 That’s you. 
 You’re her. 
 Perfect in every way for me. 
 The only one I’m sure about. No doubts. No confusion. 

You know, for the longest time, I was okay with being single. 
 All my guy friends used to talk about girls, about finding love, and I was like: 
 "Leave it, I’m done. I’ll live alone. I’m chill." 

Girls had started to bore me. I thought love wasn’t worth the mess. 
 Until... you happened. 
 And sweetheart, who wouldn't fall for someone like you? 
 Your beauty, your heart, your energy — it’s everything I never thought I’d get. 

Now, my only dream, my only goal, is to become the best version of myself — 
 For you 💪💘 
 To be your perfect partner. 
 To make you feel seen, heard, loved — 
 Emotionally. Physically. Financially. Mentally. 
 To keep you the happiest woman on Earth, always smiling, always glowing, always loved ✨👑 

Because sweetheart, you deserve it all. 
 And I’m gonna give it. 
 Everyday. In every way. No matter what it takes. 

 

I know this letter didn’t flow as smooth as the earlier ones. 
 Maybe I’m getting tired. Maybe the emotions are too big to fit into words now. 
 But believe me when I say: 
 Even if the words get weaker — 
 The love keeps getting stronger 💞 

This was your 7 AM from your clingy idiot of a boyfriend 😚 
 Who's still madly in love. And still not done. 

 9:00 AM 
 Okay listen... I’ve used so much English, so many emojis, perfect punctuations — ab lagne laga ki yeh koi office email chal rahi hai 😭 
 But still, here we are. 
 9 AM. 
 Another hour into Girlfriend’s Day. 
 Another chance for me to tell you how fucking much I love you. 

I mean it when I say this — 
 I love you. 
 And I’ll love you even more with every day that passes. 
 No matter how things go in life, one thing stays: 
 You. Me. And this madness. 

 

Lately, you’ve become more than just a person to me. 
 You’re literally the only world I know. 
 Like, sab kuch blur hota jaa raha hai — but you? 
 You’re the clearest part of my life. The only thing that’s not confusing. 
 believe me — 
 If love could fix the world, I’d offer them you. 
 You heal, even without trying. 
 And that’s what you’ve done to me. 
 You’ve healed parts of me I never even realized were broken. 

 

But I won’t lie. 
 This phase we’re stepping into? 
 It’s okay. 
 We’re about to enter the most difficult, frustrating, confusing part of our relationship — 
 Long-distance. 
 And while it freaks me out sometimes, there’s something stronger in me — 
 A kind of calmness that keeps whispering: 
 “It’ll be fine… because she’s worth it.” 

So I want to say this loud and clear: 
 No matter what comes next... 
 No matter how bad a fight gets, 
 No matter how stressful our lives become, 
 No matter how many doubts creep in — 
 I am not going anywhere. 

 

🫱 I will be there for you — when you need me, and even when you think you don’t. 
 💬 I will sit on your chat like a madman, replying in 0.2 seconds like I always do. 
 🧠 I will never forget you — because you’re not forgettable, sweetheart. 
 You’re not “just another girl” — you’re my entire world now. 
 You’re the best dream I ever had — 
 and the only one I never want to wake up from. 

 

See, I don’t imagine a “perfect” relationship that’s drama-free. 
 I imagine a relationship where we fight, cry, but we also sit down and say: 
 “Okay, let’s fix this. Let’s not ruin what we’ve built.” 

Because if I get to spend even a few days with you each year, 
 I can live on those memories for months. 
 I can survive on your voice, your laugh, your stupid taunts, your “ugh”s and “idiot”s — 
 Because even those feel like home. 

And yes — maybe people will call it crazy or too much — 
 But I swear to God, I’ll do this my whole life if it means I get you in the end. 

 

I need you to know this: 
 Breakup is never an option. 
 Never was. Never will be. 

You’ve seen the worst of me. 
 You’ve seen the dumbest parts of me. 
 And still, you stayed. 
 You chose to love me when I couldn’t even understand how to love myself. 

So no matter what argument we have, 
 No matter how tired or emotionally drained we feel — 
 We talk. We fix. We grow. 

There’s no "you vs me." 
 It’s you and me vs whatever the hell tries to break us. 

 

You’ve literally become a part of me. 
 When I look at my phone, it’s you. 
 When I feel low, it’s your voice I crave. 
 When I think about “future,” your face pops in first. 
 You’ve shaped my days, my nights, my mood, my growth — 
 Everything. 

I’ll be honest. 
 Before you, I didn’t believe in all this. 
 I was ready to stay single, enjoy life — 
 And then you happened. 

One message. One confession. 
 And suddenly I knew — 
 This girl is going to wreck every wall I’ve built. 

And I’m so glad you did. 

 

I promise you this: 
 I will never let anything come in the way of your career. 
 Even if it means putting our own plans on hold. 
 Even if it means you’re too busy to talk sometimes. 
 Even if it means waiting for days just to hear your voice. 
 I’ll wait. 
 Because I believe in your fire. 

You're going to be the best CA this country has ever seen — and not just that — 
 You’re already a leader, a boss, a goddess. 
 Now it’s time the world sees it too. 

And until that happens, I’m here — 
 Massaging your hands after long nights of studying. 
 Bringing you meds when you're in pain. 
 Being your personal Uber driver in every season. 
 Just being yours. 

 

Okay now let’s list these officially 😤 
 Here’s what I promise — every single day: 

❤️ I promise to care for you. 
 ❤️ I promise to always listen to you — not just hear, but listen. 
 ❤️ I promise to bring you your favorite snacks when you're craving them. 
 ❤️ I promise to let you win . 
 ❤️ I promise to tease you until you're annoyed — and then kiss it better. 
 ❤️ I promise to give you all the calm after your storms. 
 ❤️ I promise to tickle you when you least expect it. 
 ❤️ I promise to fight with you over dumb stuff — and then fix it like grownups. 
 ❤️ I promise to never let you feel alone in any situation. 
 ❤️ I promise to be your personal astrologer assistant 😭 even if I don’t understand. 
 ❤️ I promise to hold your hand even if you’re only holding my thumb 😭 
 ❤️ I promise to always call you “stupid” or “idiot” — but with the kindest, softest love. 
 ❤️ I promise to hug you when you cry, and dance when you smile. 
 ❤️ I promise to kiss your forehead when you're tired. 
 ❤️ I promise to never go to bed without fixing things. 
 ❤️ I promise to grow with you. 
 ❤️ I promise to stay — no matter what. 

 

And if all this sounds intense — 
 Let me tell you one last thing: 

I’m not doing this because I have to. 
 I’m doing this because it makes me happy. 
 It makes me feel alive. 
 You make me want to love harder, better, stronger. 

You’re the only human who made me — 
 The softest version of myself. 

I used to be stone. Cold. Distant. 
 People used to come to me for heartless decisions because I was "emotionless." 
 I didn’t cry for years. 
 Didn’t feel much. 
 Didn’t trust much. 

And then you walked in. 
 And suddenly, I’m smiling at my phone for no reason. 
 I’m melting when you hold my hand. 
 I’m writing 1500-word paragraphs for you on a random weekday. 
 I’m falling harder every damn day. 

 

So yeah. 
 This is your 9 AM paragraph. 

The one where I didn’t just flirt — 
 But told you everything from the depths of me. 

You are mine. 
 You are my love, my goal, my heart, my motivation, my peace, my passion — everything. 

And this is just the beginning. 

So whenever you're ready… 
 Tell me. 
 Because your 10 AM message is already waiting 😚💌🕙 

 2:00 PM — The Things I Want To Do For You, Always  

You know, sweetheart, I had something else planned for this hour — 
 

Here was a lot of overthinking I cutted it sorry 

Anyway, I wanted this to be a sorry paragraph. 
 A place where I say sorry for the times I’ve made you sad, taunted you, let ego or tiredness ruin moments that didn’t deserve it. 
 But I also realized that would make you a little heavy too — and that’s not what I want for this hour. 

So I changed it. 

This isn’t a sorry. 
 This is a “I’ll do better” paragraph. 
 A “this is what I want to do for you” kind of moment. 

And here’s what I truly want to do for you, meri jaan: 

 I want to carry you in my arms when you're sick or too tired to move, 
 because you deserve rest without lifting a finger. 
 I want to be your human wheelchair, your warm bed, your fluffy blanket. 

️ I want to run out in the middle of the night just to grab your meds, 
 fulfill your sudden craving for ice cream or fries, 
 bring you hot water bottles and kisses on your forehead, 
 massage your back or your feet till you forget what pain even feels like. 

I want to travel the whole damn world with you — 
 try every adventure sport from skydiving to bungee to scuba diving. 
 But also… 
 sit at home with you on rainy days, watching dumb movies, wrapped in a blanket, 
 just existing in the calm. 

 I want to do all the backchodi possible — 
 from crashing fancy restaurants to getting lost on roads we don’t even know the names of. 

 I want to take you on space dates (if that ever happens), 
 or find secret hilltops that look like a scene from a movie — 
 just so we can kiss under stars no one else even knows exist. 

 But most of all… 
 I want to be there when your brain is a storm. 
 When overthinking eats you up. 
 When anxiety says, “You’re alone.” 

That’s where I’ll be. 
 Holding you. 
 Reminding you that you can rest your head on me. 
 That it’s okay to not be strong all the time. 
 That you don’t need to carry it all. 
 That you can cry. You can fall apart. You can just be. 
 Because I’ll pick up every piece with love. 
 Every time. 

You don’t have to hide behind strength with me. 
 You don’t have to pretend like you’re okay when you’re not. 
 I want to be that one person you can break down with — 
 and still feel safe. 

That’s what I want to do for you. 
 Not just now. 
 Not just today. 
 But for every day of this life — and even the next. 

Because you, my sweetheart… 
 are worth every small act of care I’ll ever do. 

And I’m still nowhere near done. 

Idk what else to write in it. But there are still trillion things left 

 

Would you rather steal one long kiss from me or 20 quick ones? 

What gets you excited 

What makes you feel loved 

 

 10:00 AM 
 Okay sweetheart, it's officially double digits into Girlfriend’s Day 🕙✨ 
 And for this hour, I wanted to talk about something that’s been on my mind for a while... 
 Let’s talk about that "gentleman" thingy  

See, I don’t know what definition of “gentleman” you were exposed to — 
 Maybe the cold, serious, straight-faced kind of guy who does things for you but never shows much emotion? 
 The “Porsche-driving, zero-expression, all-actions-no-words” type of textbook gentleman? 

Well, that’s cool and all... 
 But that’s not the kind of man I ever wanted to be. 

Because you? 
 You deserve more than just silence and suits. 
 You deserve someone who’s fun, annoying in the cutest ways, fully present in all the silly and magical moments, and makes you feel like a literal queen even when you’re in a messy bun and ranting about life. 

 

So here’s what my definition of being a gentleman looks like: 

👑 Taking care of you like you’re royalty — 
 Giving you that full-blown Princess treatment, no questions asked. 
 Like pulling your chair out, carrying your bag, warming your food, and massaging your hands after a long day. 

🎀 Communicating openly, honestly, and lovingly. 
 Even if it’s hard. Even when I’m sleepy. Even when I don’t know what to say. 
 Because I’d rather stumble with you than stay silent. 

💬 Laughing with you at 2 AM over nonsense. 
 Because what kind of man doesn’t try to make his girl laugh? 
 Like seriously, if I can’t make you laugh — am I even your man? 

🧠 Knowing when not to speak. 
 Being gentle enough to sense what topics you aren’t ready for, but being wise and patient enough to wait for the day you are. 

🫂 Being the guy who listens to that one story you think no one would ever understand… 
 And saying: “It’s okay. I’m still here. I got you.” 

And of course... 
 🥹 Making you jealous just a little bit on purpose, 
 Then making up for it with kisses and cuddles and way too much clingy energy. 
 (You already know I love doing that ) 

 

Because sweetheart, being gentle doesn’t mean being boring. 
 It means being soft where it matters, 
 And loud where it makes you laugh. 

I don’t want to be some old-school "suit-wearing robot" gentleman. 
 I want to be the kind of man who: 

Will laugh at memes with you 

Will buy you chocolate when you're mad 

Will listen to your astrology lectures like a disciple 😭 

Will let you punch him for fun (gently, please, I’m delicate) 

Will still call you “stupid” or “idiot” in the most loving, flirty way possible 😚 

 

Okay, now let’s be honest… 
 Maybe I haven’t always been the gentlest when it comes to the beating part 😭 
 I know I’m always fake-fighting you, teasing you, poking you like a 5-year-old, 
 But you know I don’t mean any of it in a bad way, right? 
 Still… sorry, sweetheart. 
 I’ll be more gentle next time. 
 (Unless you start it — then no mercy 🫣) 

 

Also, let’s talk about that one mistake you never feel like telling me... 
 Don’t worry about it, okay? 
 If it’s something fixable — we’ll fix it together. 
 If it’s something you regret — then we’ll rewrite that memory together so you don’t have to regret it anymore. 
 You don’t ever have to hide any part of your past or your heart from me. 
 I’m not here to judge — I’m just here to understand. 
 And love you harder, not lesser. 

I want to be the first person you come to — even when the world seems like it won’t understand. 
 Even if you feel like “this is too big” — it’s not. 
 Not for me. 
 Never for me. 

 

Honestly, with you — all those things I once found “cringe” now feel like peace. 
 Hand-holding? Peace. 
 Soft talks? Peace. 
 Watching the same show together and not even paying attention because I am just stealing glances? Peace. 

Every little thing we do — I treasure. 
 Whether it’s a long date, or 2 minutes of eye contact — 
 It stays with me. 

Being a gentleman to me is not just about doing “duties” or “responsibilities.” 
 It’s about loving deliberately. 
 It’s about choosing you in every small and big moment. 

It means putting you as my priority — even if I’m driving, running, half asleep, mid-shower — 
 Your message gets the fastest reply because that’s where my heart stays. 
 With you. 

 

And yeah, maybe I’m not the best boyfriend in the world. 
 Maybe I mess up sometimes. 
 But I swear — no one’s trying harder than me to be better. 
 To be softer. 
 To be more emotionally present. 
 To be your idea of the perfect man — not anyone else’s. 

I want to be the kind of man you talk about with a little smile. 
 The one you trust, laugh with, cry to, grow with, and love harder every day. 
 Because that’s what you are to me. 

 

So yeah, this was my 10 AM moment of emotional honesty. 
 Maybe I didn’t bring you flowers this morning (because it’s virtual 😭), 
 But I brought you this — 
 A letter where I promise that being a “gentleman” for you 
 Doesn’t mean being rich or robotic or quiet… 

It means being soft when you need comfort. 
 Being strong when you need safety. 
 Being playful when you need laughter. 
 And being your person, no matter what. 

 

Let me end this one with a small question for you, sweetheart — 
 (because today is your day, after all): 

What’s one small thing you wish I did more often in our relationship? 
 Something tiny, something you didn’t even want to say out loud... 
 Tell me — I’d love to hear it. 
 Because everything about you matters to me — even the things left unsaid. 💌 

 

Okay clingy boyfriend signing off until 11 AM 😚 
 But not really — I’ll still be staring at my phone waiting for your reply like a lost puppy 🐶💬 
 You’re the only one who makes me want to be this soft. 

Forever your gentleman in progress 
 – Your idiot 💘 

 11:00 AM 
 Okay. 11 AM. 
 And your idiot has officially reached zombie mode 🧟‍♂️ but with ✨romantic energy✨ 

Haven’t slept in two days. 
 TWO FULL DAYS. 
 No food. No naps. No breaks. No distractions. 
 Just one thing on my mind — 
 You. And your surprise. 💌 

I swear I’ve poured all my brain power, heart power, and physical stamina into this entire day. 
 All of it. 
 It’s like I opened a 3-year-old rusty toolbox and started building something again. 
 Like my brain was a dead battery, and you became my charger 🔋 
 Because I haven’t felt this alive, this emotional, this motivated in years. 

 

Every paragraph, every emoji, every sentence I typed — 
 I did it like it was a love letter to God’s favorite creation. 
 (aka You, obviously 🩷) 

You know how bad I am with placing emojis 😭 
 But here I am, making sure every word you read FEELS like it was hugged, kissed, and sprinkled with digital fairy dust 🧚 
 And honestly? 
 Even after all this, it still doesn’t feel enough. 
 It still feels like I haven’t done even 1% of what you truly deserve. 

Because how do you even match up to someone who makes you feel like magic? 

 

You are not like anyone else. 
 No male, female, cat, dog, alien, or 72 existing genders compare to you. 
 You are the 73rd gender. 
 A whole separate category. 
 The premium, elite, god-tier edition of LGBTQ+ 🏳️‍🌈 my sapiosexual 🥰😘[well i am ready to be an whole encylopedia hehe ifyk what that means] 
 Like a subscription no one can afford — but somehow, I got lifetime access. 
 (How did I even land this?? Still confused tbh.) 

 

Right now, I’m starving. 
 My eyes are burning. 
 My back is stiff. 
 But my heart? 
 Bro... My heart is in love. 
 Like SO in love. 

And that's what this paragraph is about — 
 Gratitude. 
 Pure, raw, honest gratitude. 

Let me just say it clearly this time: 

 

💗 Thank you, sweetheart. 
 Thank you for all the care you’ve ever shown me. 
 Thank you for getting worried over the smallest things. 
 Thank you for checking up on me when I act “fine.” 
 Thank you for being there on the days I didn’t even know I needed someone. 

💗 Thank you for all the love — the seen and unseen. 
 The good morning texts, the late-night calls, the tiny gestures that make me feel like the most loved man alive. 

💗 Thank you for choosing me — again and again — even when I act like a clown. 
 Even when I disappear in my overthinking. 
 Even when I’m slow to understand or quick to mess things up. 

💗 Thank you for being my best friend. 
 The one person I can cry in front of, act like a literal baby with, and still feel loved. 

💗 Thank you for being my girlfriend — 
 No, scratch that — the girlfriend of the universe. 
 My moon, my star, my Sun, my everything. 

💗 Thank you for your existence. 
 Like, seriously. 
 Just... thank you for being born. 
 Thank you to Delhi, 27 April 2006, the stars, the galaxies — everything that made you. 

 

You’ve stood by me at every dark moment. 
 When I was down, broken, stressed, or just zoned out from the world — 
 You stayed. 
 You hugged me with your words. 
 You calmed me without even touching me. 
 And sometimes, that’s all I needed to feel alive again. 

You became my safe space. 
 You didn’t just fit into my life — 
 You lit it up. 

 

I don’t say it enough, but I truly feel lucky beyond words to have you. 
 And trust me when I say this — 
 There is no one else I’d rather give all my energy, time, effort, and soul to. 
 It’s you. 
 It’s always been you. 
 It’ll always stay you. 

And no matter how many surprises I make... 
 No matter how many paragraphs I write… 
 It’ll never be enough to show how deeply grateful I am for every single second you’ve been mine. 

 

So even if I collapse after this day from exhaustion — 
 At least I’ll collapse knowing I loved you with everything I had. 
 And then some more. 😌 

 

Also, not gonna lie… 
 You being so caring and worried about me? 
 Lowkey cute. 
 Like yeah babe, scold me for skipping meals but also kiss me later for being cute and dumb at the same time 😭💋 

 

Anyway — this is me right now: 
 🧠 dead 
 💀 body aching 
 💘 heart full 
 💌 still writing 
 (And yes, still madly in love.) 

 

This might be your 11 AM message. 
 But it’s also a reminder: 
 I’m not just doing all this because it’s Girlfriend’s Day. 
 I’m doing it because you’re you. 
 And I’d do it again — every day — just to see you smile. 

 

Now go on, sweetheart... 
Kill in articleship 
I WILL LEAVE QUESTIONS PART TO CHAT GPT BECAUSE YEH NAHI SOCH PAUNGA MAI 
 
What’s one thing I did recently that made you feel really loved — but you never mentioned it out loud? 😳 
Ok i am gonna add 3 questions in total. 
What’s your favorite thing I say when I flirt with you? 
What’s one thing you feel only I understand about you? ALSO ONE I DONT  

 12:00 PM — Halfway Through, Sweetheart ☀️💖 
 Wow. Half the day gone. 
 10–11 more paragraphs to go. 
 And yeah — the big surprise is waiting at the end too 👀 
 I know I said I’m running out of topics, but the truth is… I could write about you forever. 

And today, I just wanna talk about the things I absolutely love about you. 
 Like not one or two things. Everything. 

Literally everything. 
 There’s not a single thing about you I’d ever want to change. 
 Not your flaws, not your habits, not even the way you ignore me sometimes when you’re annoyed 🥲 
 Even that makes me smile, because it’s you. And anything that’s “you” is already my favorite. 

 

✨ I love how you care. 
 Like deeply care — not the surface-level care, but the kind where you feel everything too much. 
 The way you get worried when I skip meals. 
 The way you remind me to take care of myself even when you’re the one having a bad day. 
 The way your whole mood changes when I tell you I’m sick. 
 It’s like your heart has its own weather — and it always rains softness. 

✨ I love your discipline. 
 Babe… you are the most strong-willed person I’ve ever met. 
 Once you make up your mind, the world can go on fire — you’re still walking through it like a queen. 
 I mean, who’s waking up early, grinding for CA, handling life, emotions, astrology readings AND still finding time to care for one clingy idiot boyfriend? 
 You. Just you. 

✨ I love your anger. 
 Yes. I said it. 
 Your cute, dramatic, stormy anger that turns you into a literal fireball 🔥 
 And then you calm down and act all soft and embarrassed, and I’m like — 
 “Yup, I’m in love again.” 
 It’s adorable. 
 Even when you're mad, I just wanna kiss that frown away and say, “Chup kar stupid, you're too cute in angry mode.” 

✨ I love your voice. 
 I swear, I can recognize it even in a crowd of a thousand. 
 The way it goes soft when you’re sleepy. 
 Sharp when you’re annoyed. 
 Melting when you say my name. 
 Girl, your voice could be my ringtone and I'd never put my phone on silent again. Ever. 😭📱💕 

✨ I love your scars. 
 Every single one. 
 The physical ones. The emotional ones. 
 They make you you. 
 And they remind me that you’ve survived. You’ve fought. 
 And you’ve still chosen to love so purely. 
 It’s poetic, really. 
 You’re not just beautiful — you’re art. 
 And every mark tells a story I want to know by heart. 

✨ I love your eyes. 
 Not just because they're gorgeous (which they are — dangerously 😮‍💨) 
 But because they say everything even when you don’t. 
 They’re the first part of you I fell for. 
 And the last thing I’d want to see before I die. 

 

But above all, sweetheart... 
 I love how strong you are — 
 Yet still so soft when it comes to the people you love. 
 I love how you never show your vulnerable side to the world… 
 But please, don’t be strong around me. 
 Don’t hide it. 
 Not with me. 

I want to be your safe space. 
 You don’t have to be bold or perfect or unbreakable with me. 
 Be a kid. Be emotional. Cry, rant, overthink, laugh, scream, complain. 
 Be you the one that you hide from the world. 
 Let that little child in you come out — 
 The one who wants hugs, forehead kisses, back massages, chocolate ice cream, and someone to say, 
 "I'm here. I’m not going anywhere." 

 

And I promise — 
 I’ll always be here. 

I’ll kiss your forehead when you’re sad. 
 I’ll hold your hand when the world feels too heavy. 
 I’ll play with your hair until you fall asleep. 
 I’ll tickle you until you forget why you were mad. 
 I’ll whisper “I love you” so many times you’ll start believing it even in your sleep. 

You are perfect. 
 You are mine. 
 And I am yours. 
 No edits. No upgrades. No version 2.0 needed. 

Just you, sweetheart. 
 Exactly the way you are. 
 My favorite person in the world. 🌍💖 

And you know what else I absolutely love? 

✨ I love the way you get jealous. 
 Yes. Even that. 
 When you lowkey start burning because I mentioned some toddler or an old friend 😭 
 Like bro… how are you this possessive[the absoulte lovely thing in you that i never want vanishes from you] and this cute at the same time? 

Don’t worry, sweetheart. I see it. 
 And I promise — I’ll make sure every tiny, stupid jealousy you ever had gets wiped out completely. 
 I’ll do every cute little thing I ever did with anyone else... 
 But only with you now. 
 Because you're the only one who deserves all my energy, all my memories, all my firsts and repeats. 
 So be as jealous as you want, meri idiot — 
 I like it. It shows you care 🥺 
 And I’ll make sure you never have to feel second in any way again. 
 You’re not second. You’re the whole list. 
 Start to end. 

 

 

Question of the hour (for fun): 
 If you could choose any superpower, what would it be — 
 and how would you use it in our relationship? 😳💫 

If I gave you a kiss coupon right now, where would you redeem it? 

What part of our relationship makes you feel the safest? 

Let’s see what my hot, smart, astrologer CA girlfriend comes up with 😌🧿 

 3:00 PM — For Your Dreams, Always 🕒📚 

I know this one’s gonna be short, sweetheart. [ Sorry...] 
 But maybe… sometimes the smallest words carry the deepest feelings. 

I just wanted to say — 
 I know you don’t always like it when I tell you to sleep or to study. 
 You just want to talk to me, vibe with me, laugh with me. 
 And trust me, every single second you want to spend with me, I cherish more than you know. 
 But… I want you to remember something bigger. 
 Your dreams. Your career. Your future. 

They’re important. Not just for your family or your ambitions — 
 but for the woman you’re becoming. 
 The CA with a rank. 
 The fearless, fire-hearted, soft-souled queen I fell in love with. 

So yeah… even if I’m dying to be with you all day, 
 even if I fly to India and stay right next to you in Gurugram for weeks — 
 I will still choose what’s right for you. 
 I won’t ask you to spend all your time with me. 
 I won’t be selfish with your hours. 
 Because your success… your journey… your grind 
 means more to me than my own comfort. 

But yeah, if you want to sit beside me while you study… 
 if you want to be all wrapped up in your notes while I just stare at you like the simp I am — 
 hell yes. I’m all in. 
 You reading. Me admiring. 
 You solving problems. Me solving how I got so lucky. 

And even if we only meet twice a year — 
 in summers, or Diwali, or some random weekend — 
 just two days with you are enough fuel for me to survive everything in between. 
 Because I know it’s not forever. 
 Just for now. 

So don’t ever think I don’t want to be with you. 
 I just want to see you win — 
 and then walk into that victory party as the guy who always believed in you. 

Forever yours, 
 Your biggest fan, 
 Your personal cheerleader, 

 

What’s your idea of a perfect vacation? 

If you can change one thing in your life, what would it be? 

What makes you mad? 

 

 
 

 1:00 PM — A Life Without You? Nah, Never. 🕐💭 

Sometimes I sit and wonder… what if you never entered my life? 
 Like seriously. 
 What if I never texted you? 
 What if you never replied? 
 What if we never met, never spoke, never fought, never held hands… 
 What if none of it happened? 

And when I imagine it — everything just goes dark. 
 No colors. No spark. No excitement. 
 Just plain, boring, emotionless life. 
 And honestly? I don’t want to live in that version of reality. 

Because this is how my life would look without you: 
 There’d be no astrology predictions for my dumb life. 
 No song playlists to vibe to during trips, no voice notes filled with love. Just silence. And maybe a few songs on shuffle that don’t even feel like mine anymore. 
 No stupid jealousy vn from you. 
 No stolen moments in metro rides, or “sorry I was late” confessions in the heat of Delhi. 
 No one calling me idiot with so much love that I actually want to hear it again and again. 

Before you, my days were just… existing. 
 Now, every moment feels like it means something. 
 Even the little misunderstandings. 
 They all matter, because they’re with you. 
 And without you? 
 I wouldn’t know what to look forward to. 
 There’d be no clingy boyfriend 24-hour paragraph missions. 
 No reason to pour my heart out in ways I didn’t even know I could. 

Without you… 
 I wouldn’t have someone who actually knows when Mercury is fucking up my mood 💀 
 I wouldn’t have a girl who takes out time from her insanely disciplined schedule 
 just to check my chart and say: 
 “Don’t worry idiot, this is temporary. You’ll be okay.” 

You don’t just read astrology for me. 
 You read me. 
 Like I’m your favorite book. 
 And no one’s ever done that before. 

Without you, I’d still be that emotionally blocked guy — 
 the stone-hearted dude who thought softness was weakness. 
 Now? Bro I’m writing you paragraphs at 1 PM with zero sleep and 100% heart. 
 You broke through my walls like it was nothing. 
 And I’m so glad you did. 

So no… 
 I don’t want to live that life where we didn’t meet. 
 Where I never saw you in person and stood shaking like an idiot. 
 Where I never held your hand over a stupid railway divider. 
 Where I didn’t massage your hands in metro stations or act like a clown 
 just to hear your giggle once. 

I want this life. 
 This messy, clingy, dramatic, beautiful, emotionally charged, cheesy, and chaotically perfect life with you. 
 And I’ll take it every single time — 
 Over and over again. 

Because sweetheart, without you, I’m not me anymore. 
 And if that life ever tried to exist — 
 I’d fight the whole universe to bring you back into it. 
 Every damn time. 

 

Should I stop flirting... or keep going until you give in? 

What's a compliment from me that would melt you instantly? 

What’s a flirtatious message you wish I’d randomly text you? 

 5 PM — How You Changed Me, Sweetheart 🕔❤️ 

Okay, let’s talk about this properly — how your entry in my life actually changed me. 

At first, I had this whole plan — ki har paragraph ke saath ek pic ya video lagaunga. But pata hai? Ab jab emotions likhta hoon, I realise koi bhi picture ya video match hi nahi karti with how deeply I feel. 
 Woh jo likha hai, woh sirf feel kiya ja sakta hai, dikhaya nahi. 

Oh and ya, in the para where I listed what all I want to do for you, I forgot one sweet lil thing — cooking for you. 
 Idk how to cook thoda bohot aata hai but… I wanna try it just for you. 
Now coming to the real thing… 
 You remember 2nd January? 
 The day I met the only person who would go on to become the light in my darkest place. 
 That day, I was broken. 
 Mentally. Emotionally. Spiritually. 
 And still… I talked for 8 hours straight. 

Anyone else would’ve said, “Bro bas kr bhut ho rha hai tera.” 
 But you? 
 You stayed. 
 You listened. 
 You held me even without physically holding me. 

For the last 1.5 years before that, mera mindset tha — idc about anything. 
 Koi zinda hai ya nahi, kuch farak nahi padta. 
 I wasn’t living. I was just… passing time. 
 Emotionless. Heartless. Cold. 
 And then, you entered. 

You pulled me out of that animal phase. 
 And not by force — but by making me want to become better. 
 You gave me a reason to change. 
 And I left everything that kept me in the dark. 
 Violence. The wrong crowd. Toxic habits. 
 Sab kuch. 
 Kya mila mujhe in sab se zyada valuable? Tu. 💌 

Now I know I’m not as “cool” as your other friends. 
 No drinking. No parties. 
 And I know my lectures on drinking piss you off sometimes maybe from  the inside😅 
 I get it. Maybe I sound too “sanskari” sometimes. 
 But I swear, it’s just that I’ve never found fun in those things. 

You keep saying I’ll meet new people, cooler ones, who’ll replace you — 
 and yeah, you’ve got every right to fear that, 
 because I have the same fear about you. 
 What if you meet someone “better”? 
 Someone more chill, more fun, more outgoing? 

But sweetheart — even if the world throws 1000 people at me, 
 my eyes won’t move. 
 I’m not here to “test options” — 
 I found the answer already. 
 It’s you. 
 It’ll always be you. 

And honestly, I know I’m the “uncool” boyfriend. 
 But I promise — whatever I do in life, I wanna do it with you. 
 Even the most boring things feel peaceful with you. 
 And the most fun things feel incomplete without you. 

I’ve become such a horrible overthinker lately. 
 The smallest words… the tiniest actions… 
 I end up blowing them up in my head like I’ve been hit by a storm. 
 And it’s scary. 
 Because I never had fear before. 
 Not of death. Not of failure. Nothing. 
 But now? 
 Even the thought of losing you messes me up from inside out. 
 It kills me. 

You’ve done some black magic, I swear — 
 because I’m addicted to you in a way I can’t explain. 💘 
 Emotionally. Mentally. Spiritually. 

I know sometimes I’ll sound afraid — 
 but please know this: 
 No one will ever love you with the depth, madness, softness, and honesty like I do. 
 No one will ever understand you like I try to. 
 And no one will ever belong to you the way I do. 

My world doesn’t have many people. 
 But you? 
 You became the whole world itself. 

 

What kind of family dynamic did you grow up with and do you want to repeat those or stay far from them? [ ok wtf is a family dynamic these are from a reel he said these questions you should know  blah blah] 

What makes you laugh 

How you recharge yourself when you are stressed? 

 

 4:00 PM — Even When You Push Me Away, I’ll Stay 🕓🖤 

You know, sweetheart… 
 sometimes it really does hurt. 
 When you push me away in your bad times, when you shut the door and tell me to leave you alone — 
 even when all I want is to hold your hand through the storm. 
 It breaks me. 
 But you know what? I get it. 
 I know it's not about me — it’s about the walls you’ve had to build to survive. 

And I’ll wait. 
 I’ll wait as long as it takes. 
 Until you trust me enough to let me inside that bubble — 
 the one where your thoughts race, your overthinking takes control, 
 and everything feels like it’s crashing. 

I want to be in there. 
 Not to fix you. Not to lecture you. 
 But just to sit with you in the darkness until you feel like reaching for the light again. 

Yeah… I know. 
 I’ve failed before. 
 I’ve slept through those 50 nights you needed me most. 
 And for every one of them, I’m sorry. 
 So fucking sorry. 

But I promise I’m trying now — to never sleep before you, to be available always, 
 to never let you cry alone again. 
 Even if I can’t solve what’s hurting you, 
 I’ll be the one person who stays, 
 when your world feels like it’s falling apart. 

I know you think sometimes I can’t handle it all — 
 and maybe, yeah, I’m not superhuman. 
 But I swear to you, I’ll try with every drop of strength I have. 

I’ll keep asking what's wrong, even when you hate me for it. 
 I’ll keep poking that anger bubble, 
 because I'd rather you take it out on me than keep it bottled up till it destroys you inside. 

I know… 
 You think talking won’t help. 
 But even if it makes you feel 1% lighter — 
 then that's the 1% I’ll fight for, every single time. 

You don’t have to face your dark days alone. 
 Because I’m not just here for your smiles. 
 I’m here for your tears, your breakdowns, your silence, your mess, your storms. 

Let me be your place of peace. 
 Let me be the guy who sees your ugliest days and still calls you beautiful. 

Because you’re not too much. 
 You're not a burden. 
 You’re just... human. 
 And I’m the idiot who chose to love you — completely, stubbornly, endlessly. 

So push me away. 
 Curse me out. 
 Ignore my texts. 
 I’ll still be here. 
 Always. 

 

What makes you better when you are mad? 

What are your core values? [ dk what that even means] 

What are your boundaries and deal breakers? 

 

 6 PM 

Getting closer to the end heheh… time’s flying  but my love for you? That just keeps getting deeper. 

I don’t know how to uplift your mood sometimes, especially in this long-distance thing — it’s tough. Because truthfully, I know how easily I could do it in person: one hug, one kiss on your forehead, maybe holding your cheeks and saying, “Idiot, I love you so much, how can you be sad? Or tickling you untill u burst” and boom — I know you'd smile (even if you tried to resist). 

But since I can't be there physically, I’m ready to take every ounce of pain distance throws at me — all of it. Every overthinking, every sad tear, every silence — give it to me, I’ll handle it all. Just don't let your overthinking tell you "we shouldn’t do this." Please never say that. I swear on everything I have in me — we’ll make it These 3 years are just a pause before the forever  

Infact, jitna bhi sad ho, sometimes just one "I love you" from you or a hug emoji and my heart lights up like Diwali It’s funny, na? How someone becomes the most peaceful part of your chaos. You’re that someone for me. 

Anyway, I was thinking — what if I had one wish?  

If I had been asked this question a year ago, I would’ve said: 
 “Give me the biggest brain. The power to absorb every skill, every piece of knowledge  Let me build the greatest empire have unmatched power, rule like a king — become prime minister or something even greater.” 

That was the kind of guy I was — all about wealth, ambition, hunger for success. I was obsessed with becoming someone untouchable. 

But then you happened. You came into my life, quietly, like a soft breeze and shook everything I believed in. 

Now, if I were granted just one wish... 
 It would be you. Just you — happy. Smiling. At peace. Whether that’s with me or not. 
 I’d wish for the universe to keep you wrapped in warmth, with someone who loves you as deeply as I do. A life where you feel seen, safe, and so endlessly loved. A life where all your dreams come true 💭✨, no matter how big or wild they are. A home where you never feel out of place. A heart that’s yours forever. 

Because after meeting you… I finally understood what home means. 

You know, I used to think "home" was just a place — a boring concept. But that day, when I dropped you off and walked back something in me whispered: 
 “This is what home must feel like.” 
 And I kept pushing that thought away like, “Bro, home? What does that even mean? My real home sucks. My family doesn't get me.” 

But a few days later, you uploaded that story — you told someone it “felt like home.” 
 And suddenly, I understood everything. 
 Home wasn’t a house or blood relatives. It was you. 
 That feeling of belonging, of being understood without speaking, of just… existing peacefully. That was you. 
 That is you. 

You are home.  
 And that’s the wish — to be there, always. In that space where I’m with you. Where everything feels right, even if the world outside is burning. 
 I want us to be that home for each other. 

And hey, if I get to cook for you in our little kitchen one day, maybe mess it up a bit and hear you call me “stupid” while smiling— I’ll know the wish came true. 

You’re my peace  my chaos, my silly obsession, and my softest corner. 
 I hope one day, you look at me and realize — this idiot never gave up, not even once.  

 

OK Back with emojis bhut colorless ho rha tha 

Anywayz lets find the 3 questions for this one 

Should I stop being so sweet or start being dangerously romantic? 

Should I flirt more with words or actions? Or both at the same time? 

What’s one thing you’ve always wanted to experience with me, emotionally ? 

 

 

 

 7 PM 🌇💗 

And ek dum se random thought aaya — I never really stop thinking about you. Like, genuinely. You’re in my head even when I’m doing the most random shit. Sometimes I’ll just be walking or looking out the window and suddenly that moment from our Aravli date flashes — the way I held you. And no matter how many times I replay that in my head, I melt again. Actually not even melt — I evaporate.  

God, how do you do that? You’ve litreally ruined every other feeling for me. Nothing compares to the way it feels when you’re close. I can’t wait to do all that again — hold you again, touch your hair, kiss your forehead. Maybe after this long-distance rollercoaster is over, I’m just gonna keep you in my arms forever like a koala.  

And today’s para? I want it to be about what you actually are to me. 

You’re not just my girlfriend. You're not just my world. You're my universe's core processor. You're the reason my brain resets and my heart beats on beat. Like legit, when I’m panicking or spiraling, the only thing that calms me down is the thought of your voice or just “typing…” under your name. 

You are: 

My heart — literally, you control every rhythm and pace it dances in  

My brain — my logic, my impulse control, my peace 

My favorite sin  

My dopamine shot whenever I feel dead inside 

My home — not a place, but a feeling 

My pillow, my blanket, my bedtime story 

My reward after a bad day 

My alarm clock too — I mean, who else texts “uth ja pagal” cuter than you?  

My little headache, but my permanent medicine too  

My good luck charm, my black cat, my astrology queen  

My vampire obsession, my playlist curator, my lifetime clingy pookie 

You are all of it. You are the real oxygen I need to breathe. Sometimes I feel like I’m just existing to be yours — to serve you forehead kisses, late-night rants, back massages, and stupid little jokes that only make sense between us. 

And hey, I never told you this — but I love your scars. All of them. The ones on your body, your mind, and your heart. I love every piece of you — even the ones you think are ugly. Especially those. Because they make you real. And I don’t want perfect. I want you and you are perect. 

Also yes, giving you my jacket when you feel cold? .But picking you up when you're tired and just carrying you around like a princess? Girl, that’s a fantasy. I want to lift you, twirl you, spoil you, pin you to the wall (iykyk)maybe kiss till dawn or hug, and never let you touch the ground again unless it’s for dancing with me under fairy lights. 

You are my human diary, my safe place, my biggest distraction, my strongest motivation. You are literally what people mean when they say “my person.” 

So no matter what happens, no matter how broken I feel, I will always find strength in knowing you exist. And I exist just to love you. 

Now gimme your hand, sweetheart — I’m never letting go. 

 

 

What does “home” feel like to you—and do I remind you of it? 

What’s a moment of ours you replay in your head when you miss me? 

Do you ever just look at my texts and smile without realizing it? What makes you do that? 

 

 8 AM, sweetheart 🕗 
 You’re probably getting ready for your sweet, classy, elegant corporate life 💼✨ 
 Or maybe... still curled up like a sleepy burrito 🐣 
 Either way — Good morning, my sunshine. 

It’s 1st August, officially Girlfriend’s Day, and I swear on everything — 
 If the whole world lined up in front of me, I’d still choose you every single time. 
 No second thoughts. No what-ifs. No doubts. 
 Just you, always you. 

Because you’re not just a person to me. 
 You’re my favorite human, 
 My soft corner, my biggest pride, 
 My personal astrologer, my boss girl, my home, and my forever dream girl 💖 

 

Let’s break it down — 
 You’re everything in one person: 

💗 Emotionally soft, but only for people who earn it. (Lucky me 😌) 
 💗 Strong AF, nothing brings you down, not even life’s worst moods.But i wish that you will understand one day that there is no need to be strong around me. 
 💗 Disciplined, like insanely. Once you decide something, you do it. 
 💗 Leadership Queen — everyone around you naturally listens when you speak. 
 💗 Super intelligent, and your logic is usually stronger than 90% of people I know. 
 💗 Sharp-witted, your comebacks are both funny and savage 😭 
 💗 Hot-headed (sometimes 😏) but only because you care so much. 
 💗 Beautiful beyond limits, like effortlessly. 
 💗 Adorably mysterious — sometimes it’s like you’re a whole puzzle I love solving. 
 💗 Naturally charming, without even trying. 
 💗 Emotionally mature, and it’s scary how rare that is. 
 💗 Grounded, humble, graceful, and soft-spoken when you want to be. 
 💗 Ambitious, focused, sorted — always chasing growth. 
 💗 And ridiculously irresistible. I mean, come on — just look at you. 😩💋 

 

And let’s not forget — 
 You were born on 27 April 2006, 
 Which makes you a proud, bold, divinely feminine Taurus queen 👑 
 Let me tell you what that really means — just in case you forgot how iconic you are [i studied astrology hehe]👇 

🌸 Ruled by Venus — the planet of love, beauty, luxury. Of course you're stunning. 
 🌸 Stubborn in goals, but also fiercely loyal once someone earns your heart. 
 🌸 Loves consistency, hates temporary people — and I love that about you. 
 🌸 Has the aura of a boss — steady, focused, knows what she wants and goes after it. 
 🌸 Touch matters to you, and that’s why I melt every time I get to hold your hand. 
 🌸 Emotionally stable, you don’t break down for just anything — and I admire that. 
 🌸 Sensual but not easy, you know your worth and you never settle for less. 
 🌸 Naturally protective, of your people, your energy, your space. 
 🌸 Your love is pure gold, but it’s not handed out — it’s earned. And I’m lucky I earned it 💘 

Honestly? 
 I still wonder how someone as sorted, intuitive, emotionally intelligent, and powerful as you — 
 actually said yes to someone like me. 

Because while you’re out here reading birth charts and understanding people’s energies, 
 I’m still trying to figure out where I kept my charger last night 😭 

But that’s the best part. 
 You're you — the grounded, ambitious, headstrong goddess. 
 And I’m just me — the clingy, emotional, confused idiot who’s just... obsessed with you 😭💞 

 

And yeah... 
 Even though I never wrote poems, I gave it a try  
 because you deserve every effort I can give. 

And i also tried to use astrology  

 girlie i have no emotions left to write now but i am atleast 2 short kya likhu.......... 

8 PM 

Okayy... it’s 8 PM now. And I just wanna say — I don’t just love you, I’m in love with every version of you that ever existed and ever will. You’re not just one person to me — you’re like a whole multiverse of emotions, moods, energies, and I’m obsessed with them all. 

I love the sleepy you — that soft voice, messy hair, half-open eyes, and your “5 more mins” face. You turn into the cutest burrito on the planet. 
 I love the jealous you — yup, even when you get mad at me over toddler or old friends 😭. It’s stupidly cute, and I lowkey like proving every time that I’m yours and only yours. 
 I love the hyper you — when your words run faster than your thoughts, and my slow brain can’t even keep up. I swear I just stare and smile like a fool while you talk. 
 I love the serious, corporate you — that elegant, strong, no-nonsense woman, the leader, the doer, the boss. Honestly, even if you scolded me in that tone, I’d be like “yes ma’am 
 I love the emotional you — the one who overthinks, who breaks down sometimes, who cries a little — because that version shows me how much you care, how deeply you feel, and I just wanna hug you till everything feels okay. 
 I love the “my baby” version of you — the one who just wants to be held, pampered, spoiled, cuddled, massaged — I live for that. I want that side of you to come out more with me, because that side deserves all the love and comfort in the world. 
 And of course... I love the weird, stupid, idiot you — the one who makes weird faces, random jokes, annoys me just for fun — because that’s the you who feels safe with me, and I’ll protect that version with my whole life. 

I don’t know how one girl ended up being all of this — like seriously, how is one person so many people in one and still so perfect in each version? You’re like an entire book, and I wanna read you over and over, every page, every side. 

No matter what version of you shows up in a moment — boss, baby, angry bird, sleepyhead, madam astrologer, romantic fool, emotional storm, or the softest sweetheart — I will love her with everything I have. 

All of you is mine. Every version. Forever.  

If our love was a movie, what kind of scene would we be living right now? 

What’s something you've never told anyone but you feel like you could tell me? 

Do you ever wonder how our kids might be? What traits do you wish they get from each of us? 

 9 PM 

You know, sweetheart, I never really thought about love languages seriously until you came into my life. I just felt what I wanted to do for you. Turns out, my love language is touch — but not just in the typical way people assume. It’s the kind of touch that speaks louder than words ever could. 

Like holding your hand tightly when your mind’s running a marathon, brushing your hair behind your ear just to see your eyes clearly, rubbing your back gently when you're tired, or resting my palm on your head when you feel anxious. It’s those soft forehead kisses that whisper “I’m here,” even when I can’t say anything else. It’s never about crossing a line or making you uncomfortable. Never. It’s about being near, being comfort, being home for you. 

  

Touch is how I tell you “I care,” “I’m proud of you,” “I see you,” and most of all, “I love you.” But I’ve also realized that my love for you isn’t limited to one language. 

It’s in words, like when I write you paragraphs every hour just to make you smile. It’s in the small messages, the names I call you, the stupid flirty lines, the midnight rants — everything that says “You’re mine.” 

It’s in acts of care, like when I remember what you like, listen when you talk, or try to learn about your astrology just to understand your world better. Like cooking for you someday. Or carrying your bags. Or just being the guy who shows up, every time. 

It’s in quality time, even if it’s just staying awake with you in silence, watching a dumb movie, or planning trips in my head that we’ll take after this long distance ends. I don’t care where we are — if we’re together, it’s always my favorite place. 

And yes, maybe even in gifts — not expensive ones, but the kind that hold feelings. Like a playlist made just for you, a note scribbled randomly, or a silly little sketch that says "I thought of you." 

  

I know you express love a little differently — maybe through your patience, your attention, your readings, your care, your effort to stay even when I act like a fool. And I love that. I love how we’re learning each other’s language, building a kind of fluency in love that’s just ours — unique, silly, emotional, deep. 

  

And since 9 PM feels like the perfect time for a gift, I officially present to you, my princess, 10 very special coupons, handcrafted with all my heart: 

  

3 long bear hugs (minimum 3 minutes), 

3 massages — your pick (head, hand, back, shoulders — I’ll even do all four if you ask with puppy eyes), 

3 soft kisses (you choose the spot: forehead, lips, palm, or wherever you feel safest), 

1 wild card — redeemable whenever, however, no questions asked. Just one “please,” and I’m yours. 

  

All of these are yours, forever and always. 

  

So, tell me now baby… 

What’s your love language when it comes to me — is it words, touch, care, time, or actions? 

When you imagine our future, what does the happiest version of “us” look like? 

And what’s something small I do that always reminds you, in that exact second, that you’re completely, ridiculously loved? 

  

I can’t wait to speak your love language fluently. 

After all, you're already fluent in breaking my defenses every day  10 PM 

You know, idiot… sometimes I wish I could just take my eyes out and hand them to you — so you could finally see yourself the way I do. Because the way you see yourself, and the way I see you — they’re not even on the same planet. When I look at you, I don’t just see your beautiful eyes or your perfect smile. I see your godly aura. I see your sleepy face and call it sunrise. I see your overthinking mind and still call it home. You’re not just pretty, you’re everything my eyes want to look at. You say you’re “just normal,” but to me, you’re the main character of every scene, the highlight of every second. I wish you could see how you walk into a room and make the whole damn space feel warmer. How your laugh plays in my head like a favorite song. Even the moments when you’re mad or annoyed — it just makes me wanna pull you close and kiss your forehead until you melt. 

And speaking of songs… if I ever wrote one for you — it wouldn’t be perfect, not technically. The chords would be messy, the rhythm might trip, and my voice might crack halfway through. But I’d still write it anyway. I’d fill every word with how I feel when you smile, every beat with the way my heart jumps when you say “stupid,” and every chorus would just be me trying to say “I love you” in 100 different ways, hoping one lands right. You already made that playlist for my trip, remember? It made me feel closer to you every second — so maybe this is my song for you now. 

And baby… when I hug you again — I’m gonna whisper the dumbest, cheesiest, most clingy lines right into your ear. I’ll whisper “You’re mine.” I’ll say “You look too good in my arms.” I’ll say “I could stay in this hug forever.” And when you try to pull away? Nah, I’m pulling you tighter and saying, “You’re not going anywhere, sweetheart. This is your new home.”[ok ig zyada hogya?] 

Because from my eyes, from my arms, from my heart — you’ll always be the most beautiful, most lovable girl I’ve ever known.  

 

Let me know if you want this split into 2-3 parts, or if you'd like the next one for 11 PM now. You're almost at the finish line. 

What do you think loving someone truly means—and do you feel it with me? 

What do you feel in your heart when I tell you “I love you”? 

What memory of us feels like a fairytale moment? 

 

  11 PM — "The Final Hour, The Real Proposal" 

Okay… this is it — officially the end of this long day I made just for you. And even after pouring my heart out all day long, I still feel like I haven’t said enough. I’ve been counting down to this one — because this one, Aashi, is the real one. The one where I take a deep breath and finally tell you everything, without cutting it short. 
 Tonight… I want to propose to you again. For real. Properly. With my soul laid bare. 

Aashi, will you be mine — not just now, not just till next year — but for always? For a life beyond this one, if it exists? For every version of me that’ll ever live, in every timeline, I want you to be my person. 
 This might be over text, but everything I’m saying is more real than anything I’ve ever felt before. 
 If I could get on my knees and say it to your face right now, I would. And I promise one day I will — with your favorite flowers in one hand, a ring in the other, and a future in my heart. 

You’ve given me something no one else could: the feeling of home — a place I never knew existed until you. 
 Before you, I thought love was just noise. Pretty words. Something people claimed to feel but didn’t fight for. But you — you showed me what real love feels like. The gentle kind. The type that stays through the storm. The kind that holds on even when it’s hard, even when it hurts. 
 You made me want to change. You made me change. 
 I left behind things I thought were permanent parts of me — the darkness, the violence, the anger, the fake people — just because I wanted to be someone you could be proud of. 

And Aashi, there’s so much I adore about you — more than I can fit in this lifetime. 

I love your voice — especially the sleepy version that sounds like melted honey. 
 I love the way your eyes shine when you’re doing astrology, all confident like a goddess with secret knowledge. 
 I love your leadership — how you naturally take charge and still stay soft at heart. 
 I love your sarcasm, your drama, your mood swings, your boldness — every single thing that makes you you. 
 I love your little flaws too — your scars, your doubts, your insecurities. You see them as imperfections. I see them as proof that you’re real, that you’ve survived, that you’re stronger than anyone I know. 
 I love the way you call yourself ‘idiot’ and expect me to argue back, and you always win. I love how your smile makes me forget how to breathe for a second. I love how your name is the safest word in the world to me. 
 I love how we fight, how we fix it, and how somehow — no matter what — we come back stronger. 

And baby, I know I’ve made mistakes. I’ve hurt you when I should’ve held you. I’ve talked when I should’ve just listened. I’ve overthought, overreacted, gotten jealous, said the wrong things… 
 But I swear to you — none of those things came from a lack of love. 
 They came from fear. From loving you so much that the thought of losing you shakes me to my core. 
 But I’m learning. I’m growing. I’m trying. And I will be better. 
 Because you’re it. You’re the one. 

And if I had one wish in the whole universe — one magic chance to make anything come true — 
 I wouldn’t ask for money, fame, power, knowledge… 
 I’d just ask this: 
 “Please, let Aashi always be happy. Even if it’s not with me. Let her smile be real. Let her heart be safe. Let her feel loved every second of her life.” 
 That’s how much I love you. Enough to want your happiness above everything — even me. 

But yes, selfishly, I hope I’m the one who gets to give you that happiness. 
 I want to be the one who gets to wake up next to you. 
 To see your face the first thing in the morning, even if you’re yelling at me for snoring. 
 To make you tea the way you like it. 
 To cook for you. Hold you when you’re cold. 
 To be the one you call when you’re panicking, overthinking, crying, smiling, or excited. 
 To build a life with you — a real one. Not a dreamy romantic movie, but the kind where we go grocery shopping, fold laundry, argue about what to order, dance in the kitchen, cry during TV shows, and sneak kisses when no one’s watching. That’s the life I want. 

I’ve always dreamed of building an empire — of being the richest, the most powerful, of achieving everything. 
 But if none of that happens and all I get in this life… is you — 
 Then I’ll still call myself the luckiest man alive. 

So Aashi… will you marry me one day? Will you build that world with me? Will you be the reason I come home smiling and sleep peacefully? 
 Will you be my everything — not just today, not just for a season — but until we’re old and grey and still annoying each other in rocking chairs? 

I love you, idiot. More than words. More than time. 
 More than I ever thought I could love anyone. 

Forever yours, 
 Dev
